title: Why Maintainable Code?
---

_Striving for maintainable code is pretty much the only worthwhile endeavour in our industry._


Every day, new tools, frameworks and libraries are released and blogged about. Most of them
promise to increase productivity and reduce complexity. Most deliver as promised in the short run,
but very few have a substantial impact in the long run. And, after all, it is the long run
that is really interesting. Hence, the main subject of this blog is not new 
frameworks, programming languages, libraries or the like.

In my experience, the only thing that increases productivity and reduces complexity in the long run 
is writing maintainable code. Every day. All the time. That is what this blog is about.
