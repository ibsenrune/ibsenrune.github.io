title: A searchable link collection for code reviews
---

When doing code reviews I find myself referring to a lot of "authoritative" sources for 
information on design patterns, principles, practices, code smells, etc. To avoid having 
to paraphrase these sources in my code reviews, I provide links straight to the source itself.

Looking up these sources takes time and requires a mental context switch during the code review. 
To alleviate this I use a searchable collection of links: http://review.maintainablecode.com.

Feel free to send me a link if you would like to have something added to the collection.
