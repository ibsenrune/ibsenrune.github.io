title: A searchable link collection for code reviews
---

When doing code reviews I find myself referring to a lot of "authoritative" sources for 
information on design patterns, principles, practices, code smells, etc. Looking up these sources
takes time and requires a mental context switch during the code review. To alleviate this, I 
recently built http://review.maintainablecode.com, a searchable collection of links to my
preferred source for each subject.

If you find this useful but miss some content, feel free to send me a link and I will add it 
to the collection.
