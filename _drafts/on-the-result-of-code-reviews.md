title: On the result of code reviews
---

Teams evaluating the pros and cons of code reviews often draw wrong conclusions. This is because the main benefit of code reviews is not what they think.

Code reviews have a long history in our industry. 


Outline:
The purpose of the code review is not what you think. Most programmers think that code reviews are performed to catch bugs (Back this up with Microsoft Research Article.). Instead, the real benefit of code reviews is maintainable code. This view of things is supported by the fact (find reference) that 
the cheapest way to remove bugs is not to put them in  in the first place.
Now, this means that when teams evaluate the benefits of code reviews versus the drawbacks (a proper code review takes time), they are inclined to count the number of bugs found in code reviews, compare that to the time spent in code reviews and on that basis conclude that code reviews are not worth the effort.
