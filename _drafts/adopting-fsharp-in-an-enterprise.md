title: Adopting F# in the enterprise
tags: functional
---

Challenges:

- Testing functional code is different
  * Mocking
  * Composition
- Tooling can be a challenge
- Developers need to be eager to learn
- Developers should appreciate the strengths of F#: immutability, composability, monads etc. If developers are not mature enough to appreciate these things, they may resist.
